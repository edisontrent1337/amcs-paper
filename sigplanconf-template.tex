\begin{abstract}
	
Auditorium Mobile Classroom Service (AMCS) is an Audience Response system that is actively developed by several individuals at the TU Dresden since 2012. In the educational context, speakers and docents use it to enhance and manage their lectures during the semester. One of the main goals of AMCS is to improve the way knowledge is presented and transferred to the audience by offering interactive polls that students can participate in before, during and after a lecture.
Several standalone front end applications for platforms like iOS, Android and web are provided that enable usage of the system. However because of its ease of access, a majority of students use the system via their web browsers on different mobile devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. 
Regarding usability, design and consistency, the challenge lays in providing a unified and responsive user interface across all supported platforms that is intuitive to use. DUDE
